# Snake

Write an AI for the Snake game.

## Part 1

Implement the Snake class. `...` means you have to decide what the type should be.

```
class Snake {

  Snake(int width, int height) {

  }


  ... tick(... apple) {


  }


  void changeDirection(... Direction) {
    
  }

}
```

## Part 2
Implement the AI, a function that given a Snake and an apple returns the direction the Snake should move. This should just return the direction that gives the shortest path. It doesn't need to be an optimal path in the sense that it leads to winning the game.

```
static ... determineDirection(Snake snake, ... apple) {
  
}
```
