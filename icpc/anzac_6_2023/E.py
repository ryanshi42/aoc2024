n, k = map(int, input().split())


# numerator < denominator - 1 => impossible


# fix numerator first
# find first value such that ca / cb < 
# set n, n-1 = tree, set n = as close to a million as possible

# n-1 / n is shortest
# triangle numbers is the longest

# proof construction is to make the longest

# proof idea; construct the line as much as possible until you stop building the line
